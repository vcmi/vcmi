FindSDL2_mixer

Locate SDL2_mixer library

This module defines the following 'IMPORTED' target:

::

  SDL2::Mixer
    The SDL2_mixer library, if found.
    Have SDL2::SDL2 as a link dependency.



This module will set the following variables in your project:

::

  SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
  SDL2_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
  SDL2_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
  SDL2_MIXER_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
                              version of SDL2_mixer

This module responds to the following cache variables:

::

  SDL2_MIXER_PATH
    Set a custom SDL2_mixer Library path (default: empty)

  SDL2_MIXER_NO_DEFAULT_PATH
    Disable search SDL2_mixer Library in default path.
      If SDL2_MIXER_PATH (default: ON)
      Else (default: OFF)

  SDL2_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIR
    SDL2_mixer headers path.

  SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARY
    SDL2_mixer Library (.dll, .so, .a, etc) path.


Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARY in your project
configuration, it means CMake did not find your SDL2_mixer library
(SDL2_mixer.dll, libsdl2_mixer.so, etc). Set SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARY to point
to your SDL2_mixer library, and  configure again. This value is used to
generate the final SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARIES variable and the SDL2::Mixer target,
but when this value is unset, SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARIES and SDL2::Mixer does not
get created.


$SDL2MIXERDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDL2MIXERDIR used in building SDL2_mixer.

$SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL2.



Created by Amine Ben Hassouna:
  Adapt FindSDL_mixer.cmake to SDL2_mixer (FindSDL2_mixer.cmake).
  Add cache variables for more flexibility:
    SDL2_MIXER_PATH, SDL2_MIXER_NO_DEFAULT_PATH (for details, see doc above).
  Add SDL2 as a required dependency.
  Modernize the FindSDL2_mixer.cmake module by creating a specific target:
    SDL2::Mixer (for details, see doc above).

Original FindSDL_mixer.cmake module:
  Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
  module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
  additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
