# Step 1: Download and install VCMI

Install one of following into new folder, same as when installing new game:

-   Latest release (recommended): <https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest>
-   Daily builds (unstable): <https://builds.vcmi.download/branch/develop/Windows/>
-   Please report about problems on GitHub: [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues)

# Step 2: Installing Heroes III data files

**Since VCMI 1.2 you can skip this step, just run VCMI launcher and it will help you with importing H3 data. For older releases you can follow this step.**

-   Install Heroes III from disk or using GOG installer.
-   Copy "Data", "Maps" and "Mp3" from Heroes III to: `Documents\My Games\vcmi\`

Create this folder if it doesnt exist yet

# Step 3: connect to the mod repository

- If that's your first installation, connection to the mod repository will be configured automatically, you'll see mods available to install from VCMI launcher -
- We recommend you to install VCMI extras to support various helpful UI tweaks
