# Installation Android

## Step 1: Download and install VCMI

**This app requires original heroes 3 sod / complete files to operate, they are not supplied with this installer. it is recommended to purchase version from gog.com. Heroes 3 "hd edition" (steam version) files are not supported !!!**  
Installation is a two step process, at first you need to install game, then you need to upload Heroes3 original data files into your android device.

- Latest release on Google Play (recommended): <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.vcmi>
- Latest release as .apk file: <https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest>
- Daily builds (unstable): <https://builds.vcmi.download/branch/develop/Android/>

## Step 2: Installing Heroes III data files

a) If you purchased HoMM3 on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/de/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition), you can download the required files directly on your device.

d) The process may take a few seconds. Please be patient.

## Step 3: Configuration settings

e) After installing VCMI, open the launcher and go to **Settings** in the left sidebar. Adjust the following video settings for the best experience:

- Set **Reserved Screen Area** to **0%**.
- Increase **Interface Scaling** to the maximum value suitable for your device (e.g., 250% for an 11" tablet).
- Set **Upscaling filter** to **xBRZ x2** if not selected by default. This will enable the VCMI HD upscaling that is similar in effect to HOMM3 HD mod. Higher xBRZ selections may tank your Android device perfomance without providing a tangible benefit.

These settings will eliminate black bars and enable a full-screen VCMI experience. Enjoy!
