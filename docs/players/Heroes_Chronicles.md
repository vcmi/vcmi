# Heroes Chronicles

It also possible to play the Heroes Chronicles with VCMI. You still need a completly installed VCMI (with heroes 3 sod / complete files).

You also need Heroes Chronicles from [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_chronicles_all_chapters). You need to download the offline installer. CD installations are not supported yet.

You can use the "Install file" button in the launcher to select the downloaded exe files. This process can take a while (especially on mobile platforms) and need some temporary free space.

After that you can select Heroes Chronicles from Campaign selection menu (button or custom campaign).
