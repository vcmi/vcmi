git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow [Coding Guidelines](Coding_Guidelines.md)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Test thoroughly on your platform

### 4. Commit Changes
```bash
# Use clear, descriptive commit messages
git add .
git commit -m "Add new battle spell effect system

- Implements customizable spell animations
- Adds configuration options for effect duration
- Includes unit tests for spell effect parsing
- Updates documentation for new API"
```

### 5. Push and Submit PR
```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
# Create pull request on GitHub
```

- [ ] No merge conflicts with develop branch

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes and motivation.

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update

```

## Code Review Process

### What to Expect
1. **Automated checks** run on all PRs (CI/CD)
2. **Maintainer review** for code quality and design
3. **Community feedback** on significant changes
4. **Iterative improvements** based on feedback

### Review Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Design**: Is the approach sound and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?
- **Style**: Does it follow our guidelines?

## Coding Standards

### Code Style
Follow our [Coding Guidelines](Coding_Guidelines.md):
- Use tabs for indentation
- CamelCase for classes, camelCase for variables
- Meaningful names and comments
- Modern C++ practices (C++17+)

### Architecture Principles
- **Client-Server separation**: UI logic vs game logic
- **Serializable state**: All game state must be serializable
- **Bonus system**: Use for all stat modifications
- **Type safety**: Prefer strong typing over raw values

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all new algorithms and logic
- **Integration tests** for complex interactions
- **Manual testing** for UI and gameplay changes
- **Regression testing** for bug fixes

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```cpp
/**
 * Brief description of the class/function.
 * 
 * Detailed description explaining purpose, behavior,
 * and any important implementation details.
 * 
 * @param parameter Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 * @throws ExceptionType When this might be thrown
 */
class MyClass
{
    /**
     * Brief method description.
     * More details if needed.
     */
    void myMethod(int parameter);
};
```

### User Documentation
- Update relevant `.md` files for user-facing changes
- Include examples and screenshots for complex features
- Test documentation accuracy

## Platform Considerations

### Cross-Platform Code
- Test on multiple platforms when possible
- Use CMake for build configuration
- Avoid platform-specific code without proper abstraction
- Consider endianness and architecture differences

### Mobile Platforms
- Consider touch interface for UI changes
- Test performance on resource-constrained devices
- Account for different screen sizes and orientations
