# Creature Bank

Reward types for clearing creature bank are limited to resources, creatures, artifacts and spell.
Format of rewards is same as in [Rewardable Objects](Rewardable.md)

Deprecated in 1.6. Please use [Rewardable Objects](Rewardable.md) instead. See Conversion from 1.5 format section below for help with migration

### Example
This example defines a rewardable object with functionality similar of H3 creature bank.
See [Rewardable Objects](Rewardable.md) for detailed documentation of these properties.
```jsonc
{
	"name" : "Cyclops Stockpile",

	// Generic message to ask player whether he wants to attack a creature bank, can be replaced with custom string
	"onGuardedMessage" : 32, 
	
	// Generic message to inform player that bank was already cleared
	"onVisitedMessage" : 33, 
	
	// As an alternative to a generic message you can define 'reward' 
	// that will be granted for visiting already cleared bank, such as morale debuff
	"onVisited" : [ 
		{
			"message" : 123, // "Such a despicable act reduces your army's morale."
			"bonuses" : [ { "type" : "MORALE", "val" : -1, "duration" : "ONE_BATTLE", "description" : 99 } ]
		}
	],
	"visitMode" : "once", // Banks never reset
	// Defines layout of guards. To emulate H3 logic, 
	// use 'creatureBankNarrow' if guardian units are narrow (1-tile units)
	// or, 'creatureBankWide' if defenders are double-hex units
	"guardsLayout" : "creatureBankNarrow",
	"rewards" : [
		{
			"message" : 34,
			"appearChance" : { "min" : 0, "max" : 30 },
			"guards" : [
				{ "amount" : 4, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 4, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 4, "type" : "cyclop", "upgradeChance" : 50 },
				{ "amount" : 4, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 4, "type" : "cyclop" }
			],
			"resources" : {
				"gold" : 4000
			}
		},
		{
			"message" : 34,
			"appearChance" : { "min" : 30, "max" : 60 },
			"guards" : [
				{ "amount" : 6, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 6, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 6, "type" : "cyclop", "upgradeChance" : 50 },
				{ "amount" : 6, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 6, "type" : "cyclop" }
			],
			"resources" : {
				"gold" : 6000
			}
		},
		{
			"message" : 34,
			"appearChance" : { "min" : 60, "max" : 90 },
			"guards" : [
				{ "amount" : 8, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 8, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 8, "type" : "cyclop", "upgradeChance" : 50 },
				{ "amount" : 8, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 8, "type" : "cyclop" }
			],
			"resources" : {
				"gold" : 8000
			}
		},
		{
			"message" : 34,
			"appearChance" : { "min" : 90, "max" : 100 },
			"guards" : [
				{ "amount" : 10, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 10, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 10, "type" : "cyclop", "upgradeChance" : 50 },
				{ "amount" : 10, "type" : "cyclop" },
				{ "amount" : 10, "type" : "cyclop" }
			],
			"resources" : {
				"gold" : 10000
			}
		}
	]
},
```

### Conversion from 1.5 format
This is a list of changes that needs to be done to bank config to migrate it to 1.6 system. See [Rewardable Objects](Rewardable.md) documentation for description of new fields

- If your object type has defined `handler`, change its value from `bank` to `configurable`

- If your object has non-zero `resetDuration`, replace with `resetParameters` entry

- For each possible level, replace `chance` with `appearChance` entry

- If you have `combat_value` or `field` entries inside 'reward' - remove them. These fields are unused in both 1.5 and in 1.6

- Rename `levels` entry to `rewards`

- Add property `"visitMode" : "once"`
- Add property `"onGuardedMessage" : 119`, optionally - replace with custom message for object visit
- Add property `"onVisitedMessage" : 33`, optionally - custom message or morale debuff
- Add property `"message" : 34`, to every level of your reward, optionally - replace with custom message
