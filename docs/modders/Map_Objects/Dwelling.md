## Replacement of random dwellings

Existing maps may contain random dwellings that will be replaced with concrete dwellings on map loading.

For dwelling to be a valid replacement for such random dwelling it must be:

- block at most 2x2 tile square
- one tile in bottom row must be visitable, and another - blocked

Visible tiles (`V` in map object template mask) don't have any restrictions and can have any layout

It is possible to make dwellings that don't fulfill this requirements, however such dwellings should only be used for custom maps or random maps. Mod that adds a new faction need to also provide a set of valid dwellings that can be used for replacement of random dwellings.

Examples of valid dwellings:

- minimal - bottom row contains one blocked and one visitable tile, second row fully passable

  ```json
  "mask":[
      "AB"
  ],
  ```

- maximal - bottom row contains one blocked and one visitable tile, both tiles on second row are blocked

  ```json
  "mask":[
      "BB"
      "BA"
  ],
  ```

- extended visual - similar to maximal, but right-most column is fully passable. Note that blocked tiles still fit into 2x2 square

  ```json
  "mask":[
      "BBV"
      "BAV"
  ],
  ```
