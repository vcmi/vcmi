# Random Map Template

## Template format

``` javascript
/// Unique template name
"Triangle" : 
{
	//Optional name - useful to have several template variations with same name
	"name" : "Custom template name",
	//Any info you want to be displayed in random map menu
	"description" : "Detailed info and recommended rules",

	/// Minimal and maximal size of the map. Possible formats:
	/// Size code: s, m, l or xl for size with optional suffix "+u" for underground
	/// Numeric size, e.g.  120x120x1 (width x height x depth). Note that right now depth can only be 0 or 1
	"minSize" : "m",
	"maxSize" : "xl+u",

	/// Number of players that will be present on map (human or AI)
	"players" : "2-4",

	/// Since 1.4.0 - Optional, number of human-only players (as in original templates)
	"humans" : "1-4",

	///Optional parameter allowing to prohibit some water modes. All modes are allowed if parameter is not specified
	"allowedWaterContent" : ["none", "normal", "islands"]

	/// List of named zones, see below for format description
	"zones" :
	{
		"zoneA" : { ... },
		"zoneB" : { ... },
		"zoneC" : { ... }
	},
	"connections" :
	[
		{ "a" : "zoneA", "b" : "zoneB", "guard" : 5000, "road" : "false" },
		{ "a" : "zoneA", "b" : "zoneC", "guard" : 5000, "road" : "random" },
		{ "a" : "zoneB", "b" : "zoneC", "type" : "wide" }
		//"type" can be "guarded" (default), "wide", "fictive", "repulsive" or "forcePortal"
		//"wide" connections have no border, or guard. "fictive" and "repulsive" connections are virtual -
		//they do not create actual path, but only attract or repulse zones, respectively
	]
}
```
