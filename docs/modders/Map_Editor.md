## Create the map

<img width="145" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/188782248-b7895eb1-86a9-4f06-9309-43c6b3a3a728.png">

### New map

Create the new map by pressing **New** button from the toolbar

#### Empty map

To create empty map, define its size by choosing option from drop-down list or enter required size manually in the text fields and press Ok button. Check **Two level map** option to create map with underground.
`Note: there are no limits on map size but be careful with sizes larger predefined XL size. It will be processed quite long to create even empty map. Also, it will be difficult to work with the huge maps because of possible performance issues`

Other parameters won't be used for empty map.

To generate random map, check the **Random map** option and configure map parameters. You can select template from the drop-down list.

Templates are dynamically filtered depending on parameters you choose.

* [Default] template means that template will be randomly chosen
* If you see empty list it means that there are no templates fit your settings. It could be related to the settings chosen or it can mean that there are no templates install.

# Setup terrain

1. Select brush you want
<img width="124" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/188776299-fd688696-a98d-4f89-8bef-e81c90d3724b.png">

2. Select area you'd like to change

`Note: left mouse button selects tiles, right button removes selection`

3. Press terrain you want

<img width="116" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/188777176-1167561a-f23c-400a-a57b-be7fc90accae.png">

#### Drawing roads and rivers

Actually, the process to draw rivers or roads is exactly the same as for terrains. You need to select tiles and then choose road/river type from the panel. 

<img width="232" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/189968965-7adbd76c-9ffc-46e5-aeb7-9a79214cc506.png">

To erase roads or rivers, you need to select tiles to be cleaned and press empty button.

_Erasing works either for roads or for rivers, e.g. empty button from the roads tab erases roads only, but not rivers. You also can safely select bigger area, because it won't erase anything on tiles without roads/rivers accordingly_

### About brushes
* Buttons "1", "2", "4" - 1x1, 2x2, 4x4 brush sizes accordingly
* Button "[]" - non-additive rectangle selection
* Button "O" - lasso brush (not implemented yet)
* Button "E" - object erase, not a brush

### Fill obstacles

Map editor supports automatic obstacle placement.
Obstacle types are automatically selected for appropriate terrain types

To do that, select area (see Setup terrains) and press **Fill** button from the toolbar

## Compatibility questions

### Platform compatibility

vcmieditor is a cross-platform application, so in general can support all platforms, supported by VCMI.

However, currently it doesn't support mobile platforms.

### Engine compatibility

vcmieditor is independent application so potentially it can be installed just in the folder with existing stable vcmi. However, on the initial stages of development compatibility was not preserved because major changes were needed to introduce into vcmi library. So it's recommended to download full package to use editor.

### Map compatibility

vcmieditor haven't introduced any change into map format yet, so all maps made by vcmieditor can be easily played with any version of vcmi. At the same time, those maps can be open and read in the old map editor and vice verse - maps from old editor can be imported in the new editor. So, full compatibility is ensured here.

### Mod compatibility

vcmieditor loads set of mods using exactly same mechanism as game uses and mod manipulations can be done using vcmilaucnher application, just enable or disable mods you want and open editor to use content from those mods. In regards on compatibility, of course you need to play maps with same set of mods as you used in the editor. Good part is that is maps don't use content from the mods (even mods were enabled), it can be played on vcmi without mods as well

## Working With Mods

### Enabling and disabling mods

The mods mechanism used in map editor is the same as in game.

To enable or disable mods
* Start launcher, activate or deactivate mods you want
* Close launcher
* Run map editor

There is no button to start map editor directly from launcher, however you may use this approach to control active mods from any version of vcmi.

### Placing objects from mods

* All objects from mods will be automatically added into objects Browser. You can type mod name into filter field to find them.

<img width="269" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/189965141-62ee0d2c-2c3e-483c-98fe-63517ed51912.png">

* Objects from mods related to new terrains (if mod adds any) should not be filtered this way, instead choose terrain from terrains filter on the top of objects browser

<img width="271" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9308612/189965836-de1fd196-2f6d-4996-a62a-e2fcb52b8d74.png">

### Playing maps with mods

If you place any kind of objects from the mods, obviously, you need those mods to be installed to play the map.
Also, you need to activate them.

You also may have other mods being activated in addition to what was used during map designing.

#### Mod versions

In the future, the will be support of mods versioning so map will contain information about mods used and game can automatically search and activate required mods or let user know which are required. However, it's not implemented yet
