Updaters come in two forms: simple and complex. Simple updaters take no
parameters and are specified as strings. Complex updaters do take
parameters (sometimes optional), and are specified as structs.

Check the files in *config/heroes/* for additional usage examples.

## GROWS_WITH_LEVEL

-   Type: Complex
-   Parameters: valPer20, stepSize=1
-   Effect: Updates val to

`   ceil(valPer20 * floor(heroLevel / stepSize) / 20)`

Example: The following updater will cause a bonus to grow by 6 for every
40 levels. At first level, rounding will cause the bonus to be 0.

`   "updater" : {`  
`       "parameters" : [ 6, 2 ],`  
`       "type" : "GROWS_WITH_LEVEL"`  
`   }`

Example: The following updater will cause a bonus to grow by 3 for every
20 levels. At first level, rounding will cause the bonus to be 1.

`   "updater" : {`  
`       "parameters" : [ 3 ],`  
`       "type" : "GROWS_WITH_LEVEL"`  
`   }`

Remarks:

-   The rounding rules are designed to match the attack/defense bonus
    progression for heroes with creature specialties in HMM3.
-   There is no point in specifying val for a bonus with a
    GROWS_WITH_LEVEL updater.

## TIMES_HERO_LEVEL

-   Type: Simple
-   Effect: Updates val to

`   val * heroLevel`

Usage:

`   "updater" : "TIMES_HERO_LEVEL"`

Remark: This updater is redundant, in the sense that GROWS_WITH_LEVEL
can also express the desired scaling by setting valPer20 to 20\*val. It
has been added for convenience.

## TIMES_STACK_LEVEL

-   Type: Simple
-   Effect: Updates val to

`   val * stackLevel`

Usage:

`   "updater" : "TIMES_STACK_LEVEL"`

Remark: The stack level for war machines is 0.

## ARMY_MOVEMENT

-   Type: Complex
-   Parameters: basePerSpeed, dividePerSpeed, additionalMultiplier,
    maxValue
-   Effect: Updates val to val+= max((floor(basePerSpeed /
    dividePerSpeed)\* additionalMultiplier), maxValue)
-   Remark: this updater is designed for MOVEMENT bonus to match H3 army
    movement rules (in the example - actual movement updater, which
    produces values same as in default movement.txt).
-   Example:

`   "updater" : {`  
`       "parameters" : [ 20, 3, 10, 700 ],`  
`       "type" : "ARMY_MOVEMENT"`  
`   }`
