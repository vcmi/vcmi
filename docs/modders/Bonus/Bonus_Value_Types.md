# Bonus Value Types

Total value of Bonus is calculated using the following:

-   For each bonus source type we calculate new source value (for all bonus value types except PERCENT_TO_SOURCE and PERCENT_TO_TARGET_TYPE) using the following:
` newVal = (val * (100 + PERCENT_TO_SOURCE) / 100))`

- PERCENT_TO_TARGET_TYPE applies as PERCENT_TO_SOURCE to targetSourceType of bonus.

-   All bonus value types summarized and then used as subject of the following formula:

` clamp(((BASE_NUMBER * (100 + PERCENT_TO_BASE) / 100) + ADDITIVE_VALUE) * (100 + PERCENT_TO_ALL) / 100), INDEPENDENT_MAX, INDEPENDENT_MIN)`

Semantics of INDEPENDENT_MAX and INDEPENDENT_MIN are wrapped, and first means than bonus total value will be at least INDEPENDENT_MAX, and second means than bonus value will be at most INDEPENDENT_MIN.
